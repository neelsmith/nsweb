# 2. Identifying secondary clauses #


Once you have identified the [main clause][1], find the secondary clauses, and answer these two questions:

- What conjunction introduces the clause?
- What is the verb of the clause, and what is its tense and mood?


This should let you identify the kind of clause  (e.g., purpose, protasis of a condition...)

You can then work out any complements to the verb, as you did for the main clause.

Once you have worked out the secondary clauses, you should look at [attributive participles][2].
