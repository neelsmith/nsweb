#Guide to reading Greek prose #



When reading connected Greek prose, it can be  helpful to approach a passage
with a regular method, even if this seems somewhat mechanical.  I like to suggest the following four steps (with links to more detail about each step):

1. Identify the [principal clause][1]
2. Identify [secondary clauses][2]
3. Identify [attributive participles][3]
4. Identify [circumstantial participles][4]
