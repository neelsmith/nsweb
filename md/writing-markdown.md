# Links for Plain-Text Writing With `markdown` #


## Editors ##

There are tons of markdown-aware editors providing things like syntax highlighting and specific shortcuts for markdown, for just about any platform you can think of.  And of course since markdown is just plain text, you can use any editor that can edit plain text!  

A few that I use and like:

### For iOS ###

- [Nocs][nocs] for iOS.  Really nice with iPhone or iPad, works well with Dropbox.  Lets you browse your entire iOS file system.
- [Byword][byword] for iOS.  Handy markdown shortcuts are especially nice on tiny keyboard of iPhone or iPod.  Saves documents in its own application-specific folder.

### iPad only ###

- [Editorial][ed].  Best I've seen, with very cool workflow you can install for working with `criticmarkup` within markdown.

### For OS X ###

- [Multimarkdown Composer][mmd].  Version 2.5 includes nice support for `criticmarkup`.


## On-Line Services ##

- [leanpub][leanpub].  Publish and market your writing as e-pub, kindle .mobi, or export to pdfs including formatting options for hard-copy printing with services like [lulu][lulu].
- [draft][draft] .  Take quick notes or collaborate with multiple co-authors on tagged version. Versioning info appears to be stored in cloud only:  complement to rather than a substitute for a real version control system.


## Utilities ##

- marked:  [version 2][marked2] (includes support for [criticmarkup][cm]).  View with CSS stylesheets or export to various formats.  
- [cd2md][cd2md].  Convert citedown to pure markdown.
- `criticmarkup` [OS X services][osxserv] (from Brett Terpstra).  Not strictly markdown, but nice addition: accept/reject suggestions tagged with `criticmarkup`.


### Slide show utilities ###

The options for converting markdown to existing html+js+css slideshows are almost too numerous to list.  A few noteworthy ones:

- [mdpress][mdpress]
- [reveal.js][reveal]
- [pandoc][pandoc] (which you want anyway:  the Swiss army knife of simple-text converters) reliably generates slideshows for the following kits:
    - [dzslides][dz]
    - [s5][s5]
    - [html slidy][slidy]
