# Best undergraduate Classics program? #


Holy Cross has a unique undergraduate program in Classics.  Here are some questions that
can help you decide if it’s the right place for you to study Classics.

## The curriculum ##


How many of your classes are taught by TAs?
: HC:  0

How many Greek and Latin courses do you offer for undergraduates only?
: HC:  Every semester, we offer beginning, intermediate and advanced in both languages;  typically at least one upper-level class in Latin prose, one upper-level class in Latin poetry, and at least one upper-level Greek class.  In the fall semester, we typically offer a third upper-level “Readings in Latin” course with selections focused on different themes in Latin literature.  None of these courses repeats in a four-year cycle, so students entering at any level of Latin background can be assured of having a selection of new courses available each semester.  Typically, we offer a one-semester intensive introduction to Greek in the spring semester.  All of these courses are for undergraduates only;  all are taught by professors in the department.


Outside of Greek and Latin courses, how often do you offer undergraduate courses in    ancient history, classical archaeology, and other aspects of Classics?
: HC:  Every semester.  In a typical semester,  we offer one or more classical archaeology courses,  one or two courses of a regular  four-course sequence in ancient history,  and multiple courses on topics such as  ancient science, mythology, and Greek literature in translation.

## Fellow majors

How many majors do you have?
: HC:  Over the last several years, we have averaged ca. 70  majors.

    
How many majors study both Greek and Latin?
: HC:  All.

What proportion of majors complete 4 or more semesters of study in both Greek and Latin?
: HC:  100%.
    
Is it possible to major in Classics if I've never  studied Greek or Latin before?
: HC:  Yes.  Every year, our graduating class in Classics includes many seniors who started studying both Greek	and Latin at Holy Cross. Several professors in the department (including myself) first studied both Latin and Greek in college.


## Study abroad
      
Can Classics majors study abroad in Italy or Greece?
:HC:  Yes. Holy Cross Classics majors can study for one or two semesters at approved programs in Rome, Athens or both.    Financial aid and merit scholarships from Holy Cross apply to these programs.
